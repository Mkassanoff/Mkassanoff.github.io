      All I want is a proper cup of coffee poured in a proper copper coffee pot.
      I may be off my dot but I want a cup of coffee in a proper copper pot.
      Iron coffee pots and tin coffee pots, they are not right for me. If I
      can't have a proper cup of coffee in a proper copper coffee pot, I'll have
      a cup of tea.
