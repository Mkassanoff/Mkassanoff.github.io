      <h1>Rat Terrier</h1>
        <p>The <strong>Rat Terrier</strong> is an American dog breed with a background as a farm
          dog and hunting companion.<a href="#(1)">[1]</a> They share much ancestry with the small
           hunting dogs known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feist_(dog)">feists</a>.
           Common throughout family farms in the
           1920s and 1930s, they are now recognized by the United and American
           Kennel Clubs and are considered a rare breed.<a href="#(2)">[2]</a> Today's Rat Terrier
           is an intelligent and active small dog that is kept both for pest
           control and as a family pet.</p>

        <img alt="A typical rat terriar with pointy ears" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Rat_Terrier_head.jpg/600px-Rat_Terrier_head.jpg" width=440 height="300">
        <p>The Rat Terrier ranges from about 10 to 25 pounds (4.5 to 11.3 kg)
          and stands 10 to 18 inches (25 to 46 cm) at the shoulder. The
          miniature size – 13 inches (33 cm) and under as defined by the UKC –
          is becoming increasingly popular as a house pet and companion dog, but
           the miniature is still a hunting dog. The standard says "small to
           medium" and the miniature is small enough to go in and under those
           places where vermin like to hide. A larger strain, often in excess
           of 25 pounds (11 kg), has been developed. Called the Decker or Decker
            Giant, it was named after breeder Milton Decker who created a larger
            hunting companion and are recognized by the National Rat Terrier
            Association (NRTA, see "Breed recognition" below). UKC and AKC do
            not recognize the Decker strain as another breed, they are merely
            considered a standard variety. The NRTA recognizes a Toy variety
            weighing 10 pounds (4.5 kg) or less. The NRTA continues to classify
            the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier as the Type B Rat Terrier. In the 1970s,
             a hairless mutation appeared in a single Rat Terrier and was
             propagated into a strain of the Rat Terrier. After a period of
             development this line resulted in the
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Hairless_Terrier">American Hairless Terrier</a>,
             recognized as a separate breed by several registries.</p>
        <p>The Rat Terrier comes in a variety of coat colors. The classic
           coloring is black tan point with piebald spotting (known as black
            tricolor), but chocolate, tan (varying in shade from pale gold
            to dark mahogany), blue, isabella (pearl), lemon and apricot are
            all fairly common. They may be tricolor or bicolor, always with
            some amount of white present. Sable may overlay any of these
            colors. Creeping tan (often "Calico"), is also acceptable.
            Ticking is usually visible in the white parts of the coat, or
            in the underlying skin. Brindle, currently disallowed by the
            main breed standards, is considered by some to be a
            traditional Rat Terrier pattern, and there is a growing
            movement to have this pattern accepted into the breed.
            However,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merle_(coat_colour_in_dogs)">merle</a>
            is widely considered to be the result of recent
            outcrosses and, because of associated health problems, is
            rejected by most Rat Terrier breeders.</p>
        <p>Ear carriage is erect, but can also be tipped, or button, all of
          which contribute to an intelligent, alert expression. The tail has
          been traditionally docked to about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm), but the
          bobtail gene is very common in Rat Terriers and can result in a
          variety of tail lengths. Today, some breeders prefer a natural,
          undocked tail, which is accepted in the breed standards.</p>
        <p>Rat Terriers tend to be both intelligent and stubborn, knowing how to
           get what they want when they want it. They are also considered good
           family pets because of their energy and compatibility with kids. They
            are playful and require much exercise.</p>
        <h3 id="Temperament">Temperament </h3>
        <p>The social sensitivity of Rat Terriers makes them very trainable and
          easier to live with for the average pet owner, but it also means that
          extensive socialization from an early age is critical. Proper
          socialization of a Rat Terrier puppy includes exposing the animal to a
           wide variety of people and places, particularly during the first three
            months of life. Like most active and intelligent breeds, Rat Terriers
             tend to be happier when they receive a great deal of mental
             stimulation and exercise. Rat terriers are usually loyal to their
             owners and are very respectful, if they receive the proper amount
             of training at a young age.</p>
        <h2 id="Health">Health </h2>
        <p>Due to regular outcrossings throughout the Rat Terrier's history,
          overall it is a very hardy breed. However, with its growth in
          popularity in recent years some issues are becoming more common. The
          Canine Health Information Center (CHIC) recommends that Rat Terriers
          be tested for patellar luxation, cardiac abnormalities, pancreatic
          issues, hip dysplasia, and Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome.<a href="#(3)">[3]</a> The average
           lifespan of a well-bred Rat Terrier is 16–19 years.</p>
           <img alt="Old rat terrier with graying fur" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/16_year_old_Rat_Terrier.png/440px-16_year_old_Rat_Terrier.png" width=440 height="300">
        <h2 id="History">History </h2>
        <p>The earliest known record of a rat-catching dog is that of "Hatch",
          whose remains were recovered from the Mary Rose, the flagship of
          Henry VIII, sunk in 1545 and re-raised in 1982. Hatch is thought to
          have been a mongrel, and was brought on board to control the rat
          population.<a href="#(4)">[4]</a></p>
        <p>The breed name comes from the occupation of its earliest ancestors
          brought to the US by working-class British migrants as the dogs were
          used in rat-baiting. However they were, for the most part, bred for
          speed. Their speed is used for controlling vermin and hunting small
          game such as squirrels and hares. After the 1890s, as the breed
          type became popular in the United States, they were bred with
          Beagles, Italian Greyhounds, and Manchester Terriers. Many of the
          foundation Rat Terriers were indistinguishable from small
          mixed-breed hunting dogs known as "feists". The smaller varieties
          diverged from the Rat Terrier line very early on, with UKC
          registration for the Toy Fox Terrier beginning in 1936.</p>
        <p>Rat Terriers were cherished as loyal hunting companions and
          efficient killers of vermin on 20th-century American farms: as a
          result, they were one of the most popular dog types from the 1920s
          to the 1940s. However the widespread use of chemical pesticides and
          the growth of commercial farming led to a sharp decline in the breed
          from the 1950s onwards. Breed loyalists maintained the bloodline,
          leading to the modern Rat Terrier.</p>
        <p>The genetic diversity of the Rat Terrier has contributed to the
          overall health, keen intelligence, and soundness of the breed. Most
          modern breeds were developed from a few founding dogs and then
          propagated from a closed gene pool. In contrast, the Rat Terrier has
          benefited from a long history of refinement with regular outcrosses to
           bring in useful qualities and genetic variability.</p>
        <p>In the current times, the Rat Terrier is becoming popular not only
          as a family pet but as a working dog in several fields.</p>
        <p>Their affectionate and calm temperament along with small size has
          made them popular as service dogs in hospice, treatment for
          depression, in Assisted Living, and other human-care jobs.</p>
        <p>Police departments have started using them as contraband search dogs
          as their intelligence level shortens training to as little as three
          weeks which is much shorter than for traditional police service
          breeds. Also, their small size allows search of cars, homes, and
          prison cells without causing the major damage a large German Shepherd
          or other traditional police service breed would do during a car search
           and lessening the chances of major financial settlements if there is
           nothing found during a search.</p>
        <p>One source claims that a single terrier killed 2,501 rats in a
          seven-hour period in a rat-infested barn (an average of one rat every
          ten seconds).<a href="#(5)">[5]</a></p>
        <h2 id="Breed-recognition">Breed recognition </h2>
        <p>Rat Terrier organizations exhibit the typical disputes over the
          course of action to be taken for the promotion and preservation of the
           breed. As usual among <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_dog">working breeds</a>, points of departure are which
           dog type best represents the breed and whether the dog's working
           qualities will be sacrificed to selection for conformation show
           competition.</p>
           <img alt="Rat terrier puppy with black and white fur" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Rat_terrier.jpg/400px-Rat_terrier.jpg" width=300 height="440">
        <p>The Rat Terrier Club of America is the official breed parent club for
           the American Kennel Club. Rat Terriers were accepted into the AKC's
           terrier group June 2012. Rat terriers have been competing in the
           United Kennel Club events for over 15 years. UKC is a family-friendly
            group that promotes many different venues for dogs to compete. The
            National Rat Terrier Association is the largest independent registry
             and has maintained lineage records for decades. Feeling the working
              terrier nature of the breed will suffer, it is the most prominent
              of those clubs and associations opposed to Kennel Club
              closed-registry breeding rules.</p>
        <p>The Decker Hunting Terrier Registry was created specifically for the
          Decker Giant. This registry's mission is to keep all the qualities that
           set the Decker aside from the standard Rat Terrier, while retaining
           and improving upon the hunting ability.</p>
        <p>The UKC officially recognized the breed on January 1, 1999. The AKC
          recognized the Rat Terrier as a breed on July 1, 2010, however, it
          allowed them to compete in companion events beginning January 1, 2006
          in sanctioned AKC Companion events (Obedience, Agility, Rally). The
          first Rat Terrier to earn a title under AKC Sanctioning was in Agility
           on January 14, 2006 in Van Nuys, California by Harpur's Giddy Upp
           "Gigi" and D. Davidson Harpur.<a href="#(6)">[6]</a> AKC accepted the Rat Terrier into
           the Terrier Group in June 2012. The first AKC Champion Rat Terrier was
            "Annie" GCH GRCH King Pen RnB's Queen Ann bred, owned by Sherry &
            Dud Lee Hendrix of Modesto, California.</p>
